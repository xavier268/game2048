# Play the 2048 game on the console.

The goal was for the computer to play the famous "2048" game until it beats 
my personnal "manual" record on a regular basis ...

After trying and evaluating various strategies, the best strategy now beats my 
personnal manual record on a regular basis, at a blazing speed ...

My personnal goal is now achieved ;-)

## How to use

Need to have maven and java installed.

* on linux, just run demo.sh
* on windows, compile the java target and run it ...

**Notes**

The various strategies I have tried are still in the source, as well as the tools 
to evaluate their performance.
I also tried strategies that are "self learning". Even afetr intensivae and 
time-consuming learning,  they remain significantly below the currently 
best strategy, "LTExp with Random"

This "best" strategy is the one implementd in the MainDemo class.
